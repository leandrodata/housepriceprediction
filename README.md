# Introduction

This is an R Markdown project aiming to develop a model to predict house selling prices, developed as part of Harvard University online Professional Certificate course on Data Science, lead by Professor Rafael A. Irizarry.

The *goal* of this project is to predict homes final selling prices using a data set from Kaggle's educational competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The data set includes 79 explanatory variables of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA.

The *key steps* that were performed included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, data wrangling and training the machine learning algorithm using the inputs in one subset to predict selling prices in the test set.

*"The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset"*

The original study can be found on the link below, where Professor Dean De Cock, from Truman State University, explain the process of accessing the data and preparing it for further use.
